## What is this project?

[Enecuum](https://enecuum.com/) is a Blockchain Mobile Network for decentralized application. We create a decentralized ecosystem able to bring the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to the real mainstream, involving a crowd with regular mobile and desktop devices into the blockchain network, as well as providing the powerful toolkit for the dApps developers to create fast and low cost applications for millions of people.

To help new people with understanding our products, Enecuum maintains a [Vuepress-powered](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) website with tutorials, [Enecuum User Guides.](https://guides.enecuum.com/)
