## How to buy native ENQ

There are two types of ENQ in nature. Ethereum-based tokens (we call them "ERC20 ENQ") that were used for the private sale in 2018 and also were listed at various exchanges and payment systems as the ERC20 standard provides ease of integration. Meanwhile, Enecuum independent network has been launched and is available for Mobile Mining with rewards in Enecuum network ENQ coins. We refer to them as "native". Our partner's gateway at [suex.io](https://suex.io/) currently is the only way to buy native ENQ straight out from the app without Metamask wallet or Ethereum gas. The other side of the coin is that native ENQ purchase requires KYC procedure and has restrictions to certain countries. If these terms are inappropriate to you, consider [buying ERC20 at an Exchange](how-to-buy) and then [perform a swap](how-to-swap).
