Payment methods:

- bank cards
- e-wallets
- payment systems

When you choose the service needed, a window will appear where you can enter the amount for the deposit. This window will also contain all the terms for the currency you’ve chosen. After entering the amount and agreeing with the terms, you will get switched to the transaction confirmation window. For the top up of some fiat currencies, you will need the account verification. On this stage, you will have detailed guides inside the exchange.

Commissions and minimal top up amounts will be shown in these windows. Be attentive.

## How to withdraw funds

::: danger
**DO NOT SEND YOUR TOKENS DIRECTLY TO YOUR ENQ ADDRESS.** That WILL NOT work as intended.

After buying ENQ ERC-20 tokens, you need to **send it to an Ethereum wallet and perform a swap.** The swap is required because Enecuum is a testnet project which uses testnet ENQ coins that are not tradable. Please follow the guide below step-by-step. You will find the swap instructions at the end of the tutorial.
